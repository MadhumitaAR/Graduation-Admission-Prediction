**Project Title** : Graduate Admission Prediction Using Logistic Regression

**Dataset Link** : "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gurbanovafatima/admission-prediction"

The Graduate Admission Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model using logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of a student's admission to a graduate program. This model leverages key academic and demographic features such as GRE scores, undergraduate GPA, TOEFL scores, and research experience.

The project involves collecting a comprehensive dataset, preprocessing it to handle missing values and standardize features, and then applying logistic regression to identify significant predictors of admission. The model's goal is to provide accurate, interpretable predictions to aid students in assessing their chances and to help universities streamline their selection process. This approach ensures a transparent method for understanding how different factors impact admission decisions.

The final model will be evaluated for its predictive performance and potential for practical application. Ultimately, this project seeks to enhance the decision-making process for both applicants and admission committees.
